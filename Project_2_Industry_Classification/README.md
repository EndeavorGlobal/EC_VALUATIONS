When attempting to modify or run source code files from Project 2:
- cd into the Project Folder (open PShell terminal in IDE and 'cd Project_2_Industry_Classification')
- In the same terminal, enter: ".\venv\Scripts\activate".
- To switch to a different project or to deactivate venv, simply enter 'deactivate' in the terminal.

All necessary libraries are pre-imported into the venv. 

When pushing changed or new library imports, with VENV activated make sure to freeze new imports in PShell terminal: freeze > requirements.txt
